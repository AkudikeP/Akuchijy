We will do a quality check at our end subsequently to ensure the product has been executed as per your order and measurement and deliver back to you.</li>

<li>We also provide garments on rent. You can choose the garment of your choice from our website and we will get it delivered to you. The garment will be collected again by us once you are done using it. </li>
